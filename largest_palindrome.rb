# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# Even though the numbers would always be bigger (increasing), due to the multiplication, the second constraint (whether it was a palindrome or not)
# was making it OUT of order. SO the last number that was a palindrome was not necessarily the biggest....
# I WOULD think however, that they would be 
# its just the fluctuation of how the numbers are multiplied that makes them out of order. because it goes 100 * 100..999 then 101..999 then 102..999
# so it goes high, then drops, then high, then drops.... I guess.
